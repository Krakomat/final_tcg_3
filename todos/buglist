GameModel: 
	- You are able to evolve a pokemon on the first turn
	- Retreat is allowed only once per turn
	- A Confused Pokémon can retreat to the Bench normally (without coinflipping), where it loses all Special Conditions
	- If a Pokémon is Asleep, Confused, or Paralyzed, and a new attack is made against it that makes it Asleep, Confused, or Paralyzed, the old condition should be 
	  erased and only the new one counts. But these three conditions are the only effects that erase each other. So, for example, a Pokémon can be Confused and 
	  Burned at the same time.
