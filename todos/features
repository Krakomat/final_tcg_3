View:
	- Add further Animations (For attacks, etc.)
	- Rework distribution view, s.t. the minus button can be pressed so long until the resources on the pokemon are gone and not just once. Also add a balance counter.
	
GameModel: 
	- time counter for each turn
	- Implement timer for (single) actions for a client

AI:
	- (HARD!) Enhanced bot that knows what he's doing
	- Add parameter for the rest cards in the bots deck (the bot knows his own cards)
